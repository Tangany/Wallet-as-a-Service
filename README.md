Tangany offers a technological solution, called 'Wallet as a Service', for companies to use blockchain. These integrate easily and securely blockchain into their systems by using our modern blockchain API. The service will handle the storage of private keys and the signing of transactions in the cloud as well as blockchain access via a stable node infrastructure.

Clients are saving a lot of development time and costs as they can use a full and ready solution instead of developing an individual one. In addition, the blockchain usability for clients and users is increased enormously - no more hassle with private keys management.

## PRIVATE KEY HSM VAULT
We use a Hardware Security Module (HSM) that provides the highest security standard for private key storage solution (FIPS 140-2 Level 2).

## UNIFIED API
Our well documented API helps you to create blockchain based applications. One API for all blockchain-related tasks and direct access to different blockchains.

## TRANSACTION SIGNER
Sign transaction easily with our module for all your connected blockchains. The signing is done securely within the Private Key Vault.

## NODE INFRASTRUCTURE
Choose whatever blockchain suits your needs the most. Clients can connect to public Blockchains like Ethereum, Bitcoin just as to Private Blockchains.
