Two of the key challenges for blockchain usage is to deal with the lack of security and the insufficient usability. 
Tangany is developing convincing technical solutions and enhance them with the aspects of trust and guidance. 
Our mission is to grant everyone easy access to the blockchain and make all transactions, regardless of the blockchain, simple and secure. 

## Personal Wallet
Manage all your tokenized assets with Tangany wallet. With our dashboard you can manage all connected apps, dApps, programs and websites.

### Protection of Privacy
Prevent other people to get insight into your transactions. Make transactions on blockchain applications without privacy risks.

### Dashboard
View and manage all your Blockchain assets. Analyze your transactions and optimize your Crypto assets. Move assets from one program (e.g. dApps) to another easily.

### Account Recovery
Never lose access to your data or private keys again. If you have forgotten your password, you can easily restore it. However, if you want to manage your private key yourself, you can do so at any time.

### Usability
Usability is one of our key goals. We aim for simplicity without sacrificing security and privacy.
