Two of the key challenges for blockchain usage is to deal with the lack of security and the insufficient usability. 
Tangany is developing convincing technical solutions and enhance them with the aspects of trust and guidance. 
Our mission is to grant everyone easy access to the blockchain and make all transactions, regardless of the blockchain, simple and secure. 

## Personal Wallet
Manage all your tokenized assets with Tangany wallet. With our dashboard you can manage all connected apps, dApps, programs and websites. If you are missing a resource, let us know and we will try to cooperate with the provider.

### Protection of Privacy
Blockchain applications are currently still a big privacy risk. Our shield-technology provides sufficient protection so that other people do not get insight into your transactions. And best of all, everything is automated and in the background.

### Dashboard
The Tangany Dashboard lets you view and manage all your Blockchain assets. Analyze your transactions and optimize your Crypto assets. Moving assets from one program (e.g. dApps) to another has never been easier.

### Account Recovery
Never lose access to your data or private keys again. If you have forgotten your password, you can easily restore it. However, if you want to manage your private key yourself, you can do so at any time.

### Usability
Usability is one of Tangany Wallet’s key goals. Everything should always be as simple as possible without sacrificing security and privacy. That is what our Cloud Wallet offers.
